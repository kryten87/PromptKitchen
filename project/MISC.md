# Design & Functionality

# New Features
- need a way to match results similar to jest matchers
- close button for prompt view
- view last tests results when looking at a test suite
- test results during tests -- show expected and actual values

# DONE --------------------------

# Issues I'm seeing with the prompts
- failing to check things off
- failing to use `npm run check` to test
- too much stopping & asking me if I'd like to continue

use LLM to refine fix-problem and use-task-ledger prompts

sort out front end/back end ports/proxies
