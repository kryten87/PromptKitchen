frontend/src/mocks -- what is this?

rewrite dashboard page specs

are there dtos for every model?

refactor functions into small, pure helpers

sort out front end/back end ports/proxies

shared eslint config -- warnings

logging system -- frontend & backend

ensure that access control is working -- person A can only see projects for person A

use LLM to refine fix-problem and use-task-ledger prompts



# Issues I'm seeing with the prompts
- failing to check things off
- failing to use `npm run check` to test
- too much stopping & asking me if I'd like to continue
