# Dashboard Page Design

## Inital Prompt

This was provided to [V0](https://v0.dev).

```
I want to build a tool for running tests against prompts. the dashboard page should have a top menu bar with the user's avatar image right justified. the page name should be left justified (in this case "Dashboard").On the left will be a menu bar with entries like "Project", "Analytics". At the bottom of the menu bar are  "Settings", and "Help"In the main body of the page will be a list of project in a table. The table will include Title, Last Updated Date, Current Status (Passing, Failing, or No Tests Run)
```
